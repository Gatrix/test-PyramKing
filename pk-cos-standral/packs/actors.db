One morning, their father and their uncle took them fishing on Lake Zarovich. On the way back to town, a dire wolf attacked Izek and bit off his right arm. His father carried Izek back to town while his uncle distracted the beast. His sister ran and hid in the woods and was never seen again.</p>\n<p>Unlike his sister, Izek was born without a soul. As time wore on, he forgot his lost sister and learned to cope with his disability.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Orphaned Killer.</strong></em> Izek’s parents succumbed to their grief, leaving him an orphan. He became a sociopath. Other children ruthlessly mocked him because of his dead family and his missing arm, but he was a large boy and had no trouble killing them and disposing of their bodies. He was eventually caught in the act and brought to the burgomaster. Instead of punishing the boy for his crimes, Baron Vallakovich pardoned Izek and took him into his home. Izek has been loyal to the burgomaster ever since, enjoying the power of his position and the comforts of his master’s mansion. When he isn’t enforcing the burgomaster’s will, Izek drinks copious amounts of wine.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fiendish Gift.</strong></em> After years of doing Baron Vallakovich’s dirty work, Izek awakened from a drunken stupor one morning to find that he had grown a new arm to replace the one he had lost.</p>\n<p>The new appendage has barbed spines, elongated fingers, and long nails. He can create fire with the snap of his fiendish fingers and has used the flames to put the fear of the devil in every Vallakian.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Doll Collector.</strong></em> Perhaps more disturbing than his fiendish arm and his murderous nature is Izek’s collection of dolls, which he keeps in his bedroom in the burgomaster’s mansion. Izek often has dreams of a beautiful young woman, and for years he has forced a local toymaker named Gadof Blinsky to craft dolls in her likeness. The woman is Ireena Kolyana, although Izek doesn’t know her name.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Family Is Forever.</strong></em> Izek has dreams of Ireena. If he spots her, he tries to take her by force to the burgomaster’s mansion. If he succeeds, he holds her captive in his bedroom (<a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-town-of-vallaki\">chapter 5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#N3jIzeksBedroom\">area N3j</a>). Unknown to Izek and Ireena, they are brother and sister. Ireena fled after Izek was attacked by the dire wolf and became lost in the woods. She wandered for days in shock until she was found and adopted by Kolyan Indirovich in the village of Barovia. Izek covets her in an unwholesome way and won’t allow anyone or anything to come between them.</p>\n<h4>Izek Strazni’s Traits</h4>\n<p><em><strong>Ideal.</strong></em> “Fear is a powerful weapon.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world.

They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

creature prized by arcanists for their ability to navigate terrain in near total darkness.  This alone makes them a prized choice for a summoned familiar.  Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight!  Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp.  What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night.  The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath.  The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigations without the aid of their eyes.  It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders.

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities.

Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own.
